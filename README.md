This extension is used for demo purpose.

## Installation

Install dependencies:
`yarn` or `npm install`

```
Note: Node.js version 7.x or greater is needed
```

## Running locally

Make sure you have NodeJS & all dependencies installed.

Start the development server by running

```
yarn run dev
```

Basically something similar to what the webpack hot reload middleware does. When you change the code and the webpack trigger and finish the compilation, your extension is notified and then reloaded using the standard browser runtime API.
